/**
 * A DebuggerEventListener implementation that
 * performs an assertion and then an action.
 * 
 * Both behaviors are delegated into smaller objects (strategies)
 * to make it more flexible like in  DSL.
 * 
 * Also the condition to perform the assertion and action is also delegated
 * into a third object a DebugEventMatcher
 * 
 * So:
 *  - DebugEventMatcher: knows which point is important to execute this.
 *  - DebugSessionAsserter: knows what to assert
 *  - DebugSessionAction: knows what to do after asserting
 *
